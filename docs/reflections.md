1 What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
I learned alot. I learned how to properly set stats, to be resourceful, how to implement a slide screen for choice selection. I worked mainly with switch statements and objects as well as math.floor type functions so that really solitifed some basic concepts we went over.
2 What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?
APIs and fetch statements
Functions for sure

Those are two topics I feel as if practice just makes perfect on.
