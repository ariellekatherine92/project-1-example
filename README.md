# Sailor Moon Fighter!

The game built starts with the player choosing their character or scout to fight with. The player then finds a villain and attacks until they have defended the moon kingdom from their enemies.


# HOW TO PLAY

Player chooses a sailor scout on first page to attack with. Once scout is chosen you are then taken to a battle screen to begin. Player will press "find a villain. Villain will randomize on the screen. 

Once villain is on the screen player can hit attack until villain health is down to 0 or until villain has defeated the player.

Once winner is declared press reset on top of screen to restart game and choose another scout to play with!

# FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

There are so many things I would like to add to this game. It took me a week just to get the mechanics and basics of the game to working capacity. If I had more time however, I would really expand this to resemble a mortal combat style game. The characters could then move around screen and unleash special attacks/moves. You could choose from either scouts or villains and the game would be multi player with a leaderboard.

I would also toy with the idea of making this an app as well that people could download on their phones and play more globally.

I would have to obviously purchase some sort of licensing agreements as the characters do not belong to me however, looking into this seems to be something that could be done.

I would also like to add some other artwork and better character silhouettes.
