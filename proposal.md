# Proposal of Game
Proposal for Game Project 1:

	Sailor Moon Game:

Game will start with choosing 1 or 2 players for the game. Players can then choose a character to use. Character choices will be limited to about 6 characters to choose from.

The premise of the game will be to hit the other player until one dies with direct hits. There will be a health allotment per player and the first player to get the other player to 0 health will win the game. 

I would like to create a leaderboard so people can see where they stand against other players.

The game will move through a couple screens and include a choose your character screen, a fighting screen, and a “what player won” screen. 

Characters Images will be chibi-like characters pulled from the internet. I plan to add in some audio in the beginning as well. 

I plan to keep the mechanics really simple but adding in more elaborate styling because this is where I believe my strengths to be.

My game plan for the intial build of the game is to get all the mechanics functioning properly. I know the actual skeleton will take me a longer time to complete as Javascript is not my strength YET. 

At this point my initial game plan is to build out the html and javascript and getting those to a working state.
